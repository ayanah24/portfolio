                <h3>3.basic calculator</h3>
                <P>Creating a calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript involves several steps. Here's an overview of the theoretical aspects behind the implementation:

                    1. Structure (HTML)
                    The HTML structure lays the foundation of the calculator's interface. It includes the display screen for showing numbers and results, as well as buttons for digits, operations, and control actions (like clear).
                    
                    Display: A div element that shows the current input or result.
                    Buttons: Several button elements for numbers, operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division), and other functionalities (clear, equals).
                    2. Styling (CSS)
                    The CSS is used to make the calculator visually appealing and functional. The main goals here are to:
                    
                    Arrange the buttons in a grid layout.
                    
                    Style the display and buttons to look like a physical calculator.
                    
                    Apply hover and active states for better user interaction feedback.
                    
                    Grid Layout: CSS Grid is used to align buttons in rows and columns.
                    
                    Styling: Buttons and display have background colors, padding, borders, and rounded corners to resemble a real calculator.
                    
                    3. Functionality (JavaScript)
                    JavaScript adds the interactive functionality to the calculator. It handles user input, performs calculations, and updates the display.
                    
                    Event Listeners: Each button has an onclick event listener that triggers appropriate functions (e.g., appending a number, choosing an operation, calculating the result).
                    State Management: Variables are used to keep track of the current input (currentNumber), the previous input (previousNumber), and the selected operation (operator).
                    Functions:
                    appendNumber(number): Adds a digit to the current input.
                    chooseOperation(op): Sets the operator and prepares for the next input.
                    calculate(): Computes the result based on the selected operator and inputs.
                    clearDisplay(): Resets the display and state variables.
                    updateDisplay(): Updates the display element to show the current input or result.
